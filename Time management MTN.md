### Prioritize
Sam became distracted because he did not have a clear plan and he did not prioritize his work. This led to time being lost performing unproductive work.

Each day, it is important to know what you _need_ to accomplish and what you _want_ to accomplish. What you _need_ to accomplish is the priority. What you _want_ to accomplish can be additional work you perform after your priorities are met. For Sam, completing the two reports for his boss was what he _needed_ to accomplish—the reports were his priority. After that came the emails and finally, with whatever time he had remaining, _perhaps_ researching the sales numbers. Why “perhaps?” The sales numbers were not due until the following Thursday and it is very likely that Sam had other deadlines before Thursday.

In short, it’s crucial to make sure you know what you're supposed to be doing. While this sounds obvious and easy, it can also be challenging in some situations. For instance, if you’re new to your job, you may not yet have a good feel for your responsibilities.

Know what you want to accomplish and what you need to accomplish and when. Use this information to create your plan.
