- If f is a function from A to B, we say that A is the ==domain== of f and B is the ==codomain== of f.
### f(A) = B

- From the above, we say that B is the ==image== of A and A is a ==preimage== of b. The range, or image, of f is the set of all images of elements of A. Also, if f is a function from A to B, we say that f maps A to B.

- **Domain**: The set of all possible input values for a function. Every element in the domain is mapped to an output through the function. It is essentially the set from which the function can take its arguments.

- **Codomain**: The set of all possible output values **that are allowed** by the function, whether or not every element in this set is actually produced by the function. The codomain is a broader set that includes all potential outputs, but not all of them necessarily have a corresponding input.

- **Range** (or **image**): The range is the set of all actual values that the function produces when applied to every element of the domain. In other words, the range is the set of outputs that **actually occur** when the function is applied to its domain.

###### **Note:** If we change either the domain or the codomain of a function, then we obtain a diﬀerent function. If we change the mapping of elements, then we also obtain a diﬀerent function.

- A function is called **real-valued** if its codomain is the set of real numbers, and it is called **integer-valued** if its codomain is the set of integers.


- Let f1 and f2 be functions from A to R. Then f1 + f2 and f1 f2 are also functions from A to R deﬁned for all x ∈ A by ( f1 + f2 )(x) = f1 (x) + f2 (x), ( f1 f2 )(x) = f1 (x)f2(x).
