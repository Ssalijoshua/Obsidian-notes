- **A theorem** is a statement that can be shown to be true. They can also be referred to as **facts** or **results.** 
- A **proof** is used to demonstrate that a theorem is true. **A proof** therefore is a valid argument that establishes the truth of a theorem.
- **Axioms**(or **postulates**) are the statements used in a proof.
- **Lemma** is helpful in the proof of other results. Complicated proofs are usually easier to understand when they are proved using a series of lemmas, where each lemma is proved individually.
- A **Corollary** is a theorem that can be established directly from a theorem that has been proven individually.
- A **conjecture** is a statement that is proposed to be true basing on a heuristic, partial evidence or on the intuition of an expert. When the proof of a conjecture is found, it becomes a theorem. 

- When doing proofs, it is advisable that we try all the possible otpions. Try a direct proof, if it fails then do a proof by contraposition. If that fails as well then you can try either a vacuous or a trivial proof. Keep trying even upto the proof by contradiction.
