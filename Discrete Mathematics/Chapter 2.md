#### Introduction
- **A set** is an unordered collection of distinct objects, called elements or members of the set. A set is said to contain its elements. We write a ∈ A to denote that a is an element of the set A. The notation a ∉ A denotes that a is not an element of the set A.
- **Set builder notation** of representing a set O is O = {x ∣ x is an odd positive integer less than 10}
