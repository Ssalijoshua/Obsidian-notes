Defined as the are of logic that deals with propositions.

**A proposition** is a declarative statement that is either true or false, but not both.

#### Examples
1. Washington, D.C., is the capital of the United States of America.
2. Toronto is the capital of Canada.
3. 1 + 1 = 2.
4. 2 + 2 = 3.
Propositions 1 and 3 are true, whereas 2 and 4 are false.

Anyother statement that doesnt hold a truth or false value isnt a proposition. For example,
- What time is it?
- Check him out
- x = 5 + y

[[Atomic propositions]] are propositions which cannot be expressed into simpler propositions.
[[Compound propositions]] are formed as new propositions using [[Logical operators or connectives]]. 
These logical operators are also known as ==connectives==.They include (~, v, ^, ->).

**A tautology** is a statement that it always true.
**A contradiction** is a statement that is always false.
