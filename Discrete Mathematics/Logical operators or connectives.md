#### Negation operator
<u>Example:  Finding the negation of a statement P</u>
P
Ans: It is not the case that P

Ssali has an Iphone
It is not the case that Ssali has an Iphone
Ssali doesnot have an iphone

###### Truth table for a Not

| P   | -P  |
| --- | --- |
| T   | F   |
| F   | T   |

#### Conjunction operator
We have 2 statements P and Q. The conjunction of P and Q is P ^ Q. 
###### Truth table for conjunction of 2 propositions

| P   | Q   | P ^ Q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| T   | F   | F     |
| F   | T   | F     |
| F   | F   | F     |
| T   | T   | T     |
#### Disjunction operator
Disjunction of P and Q is represented as P v Q. 
###### Truth table for the disjunction of P and Q

| P   | Q   | P v Q |
| --- | --- | ----- |
| F   | F   | F     |
| T   | F   | T     |
| F   | T   | T     |
| T   | T   | T     |
For the disjunction we need to take note of the exclusive or and the inclusive or. 
**Exclusive or** :- both statements cannot be true or false at the same time.
**Inclusive or** :- both statements can be true and false at the same time.

#### Conditional statements or Implication
P and Q are propositions, P -> Q is read as "if P then Q".
P is called the <u>hypothesis or antecedent or premise</u>
Q is called the <u>conclusion or consequence</u>

#### Truth table for the implication

| P   | Q   | P -> Q |
| --- | --- | ------ |
| T   | T   | T      |
| T   | F   | F      |
| F   | T   | T      |
| F   | F   | T      |
**Examples**

“If I am elected, then I will lower taxes.”
If the politician is elected, voters would expect this politician to lower taxes. Furthermore, if
the politician is not elected, then voters will not have any expectation that this person will lower taxes, although the person may have suﬃcient inﬂuence to cause those in power to lower taxes.
It is only when the politician is elected but does not lower taxes that voters can say that the
politician has broken the campaign pledge. This last scenario corresponds to the case when P is true but Q is false in p → q.


#### Logic of equivalence
-(P ^ Q) = -P v -Q
