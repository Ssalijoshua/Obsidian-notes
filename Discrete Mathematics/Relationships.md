#### Injections(One to one)

- Condition is if x1 != x2 then f(x1) != f(x2)
- A function f is said to be one-to-one, or an injection, if and only if **f (a) = f (b)** implies that a = b for all a and b in the domain of f. A function is said to be injective if it is one-to-one.

- Meaning that all the values in the domain map to exactly one output in the codomain.


#### Surjections(onto)
- A function f from A to B is called onto, or a surjection, if and only if for every element b ∈ B there is an element a ∈ A with f (a) = b.


#### Bijections
- The function f is a one-to-one correspondence, or a bijection, if it is both one-to-one and onto. We also say that such a function is bijective.

#### summary
- Suppose that f : A → B. To show that f is injective Show that if f(x) = f (y) for arbitrary x, y ∈ A, then x = y. 
- To show that f is not injective Find particular elements x, y ∈ A such that x ≠ y and f (x) = f (y). 
- To show that f is surjective Consider an arbitrary element y ∈ B and ﬁnd an element x ∈ A such that f (x) = y. 
- To show that f is not surjective Find a particular y ∈ B such that f (x) ≠ y for all x ∈ A.
